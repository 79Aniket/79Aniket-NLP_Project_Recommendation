# Movies_recommendation_system
## The project is focused on building a movie recommendation system using data from two primary datasets: tmdb_5000_credits.csv and tmdb_5000_movies.csv. It combines data science techniques, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning to recommend movies based on content similarities.

Key Components:
Data Preprocessing:

The project begins by importing essential libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, nltk for natural language processing, and sklearn for implementing machine learning algorithms.
The datasets, which contain movie information like credits, titles, and languages, are merged based on the movie title, forming a comprehensive dataset for further analysis.
Natural Language Processing (NLP):

NLP techniques are employed to process textual data. Specifically, word tokenization and stemming are applied using the nltk library to extract meaningful features from the movie descriptions.
Stopwords are removed, and a CountVectorizer is used to convert text into vectors, which represent word frequencies and allow for numerical comparison between movie descriptions.
Cosine Similarity:

The model uses cosine similarity to find how closely related one movie is to another based on the processed text features. This method measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, providing a metric of similarity between movie content.
Feature Engineering:

Several columns of the dataset, such as the movie title, language, and other metadata, are engineered and transformed to create features that will feed into the recommendation model.
Preprocessing steps include checking the uniqueness of languages and dealing with any missing or erroneous data.
Objective:
The goal of the project is to recommend movies based on the content of the films by analyzing textual data such as plot summaries or other metadata, making it a content-based recommendation system. By utilizing techniques like cosine similarity, the system can suggest movies similar to a user's preferred choices.

This project demonstrates the practical application of NLP and machine learning in a real-world scenario, creating a system that personalizes movie recommendations based on the similarity of content, genres, or other relevant factors in the data.
